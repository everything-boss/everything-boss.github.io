          Trump has always been compared to the fictional character Voldemort. Everyone has decided that Trump's evilness is comparable to the Dark Lord's. But what will happen when they actually meet... Will they become friends or foes? Will they make avada kedevra or America great again? Or will they make a truce and march to the Illuminerty, and help them with destroying the universe? Many, many questions have been asked, but now the event we have all been dreading has come...

        Together, they will take a Portkey to the headquarters of the Illuminerty, anchored at the edge of a wormhole. There they will blackmail the Illuminerty by saying they will use the wrath of Beyonce on them. So the Illuminerty have no choice but to resign to Voldemort. But little did any of them know... that Voldemort made a mistake during the cloning of Trump. Have you ever wondered where Voldemort's nose was? Well, the asnwer is it escaped from the books before his body did, and took it's mortal form as or reporter,
